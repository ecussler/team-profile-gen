# Team-Profile-Generator [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)]
Program using Node.js to generate a team profile page.

  ## Description
  This profile generator uses the inquirer package to prompt the user to enter information (name, ID, email, et al.) to then generate a team profile page.  This app is meant to demonstrate: 

  - Use of Node to run inquirer and generate a full index.html
  - Organized app folders 
  - Implementation of classes and subclasses to generate position specific questions
  - Testing for each class/subclass that all pass. 

  This was a hefty project but overall satisfying. I was able to streamline my program as I went along, using some unique inquirer functions and more modern JS. While difficult, this project was a fun one for me to tackle.
